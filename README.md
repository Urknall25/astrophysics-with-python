# Astrophysics with Python 🚀🪐

Welcome to **Astrophysics with Python** — a collection of projects that combine Python programming with the fascinating world of space and physics. Each project explores a different astrophysics concept through code, simulation, or data analysis.

## 🧠 Why this repo?

As a student passionate about astrophysics and Python, I'm building this repository to:
- Practice solving real physics problems with code
- Learn scientific concepts by simulating them
- Build a portfolio to share with teachers, mentors, and (someday) colleges like MIT

## 📁 Projects

### 🌍 Orbital Mechanics Simulation
**Status:** Done  
Simulates a planet orbiting a star using Newton's law of universal gravitation. Visualizes the orbit path using `matplotlib`.

> 🔧 *Coming soon: support for multiple planets and variable initial speeds!*

---

More projects to come soon:
- Light curve analyzer (exoplanet detection)
- AI galaxy classifier
- Gravitational lensing visualizer
- N-body simulation

---

## 🛠️ Tech Used

- Python 3
- `numpy` for math
- `matplotlib` for visualization
- Possibly `pygame` or `scikit-learn` for advanced projects

---

## ✨ Goals

- Understand core astrophysics ideas by building them
- Get better at Python and scientific computing
- Have fun exploring the universe from my computer
