# Orbital Mechanics Simulation 🌍🛰️

This project simulates a planet orbiting a star using Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation and basic physics.

You can watch the orbit evolve over time with a live animation and even see a fading trail behind the planet!

## 🚀 Features

- Realistic gravitational physics
- Adjustable orbital parameters (mass, velocity, distance, etc.)
- Fading orbit trail for a cool visual effect
- Uses `matplotlib` for animation
- Based on Earth's orbit around the Sun

## 📁 Files

- `main.py` — Main simulation script
- `README.md` — You're here!

## 🧠 Physics Behind It

The force between the star and the planet is calculated using:
F = G * (m1 * m2) / r²

Where:
- `G` is the gravitational constant
- `m1` and `m2` are the masses
- `r` is the distance between them

This force updates the planet’s velocity and position using basic kinematics.

## 🔧 Requirements

You’ll need Python and these libraries:
- `matplotlib`
- `math`

Install them using:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
